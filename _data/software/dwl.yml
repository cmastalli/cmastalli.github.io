  The *Dynamic Whole-body Locomotion* library (DWL) implements a set of functionalities to develop, design, and deploy motion planning, control and perception algorithms for legged locomotion. DWL has different modules such as: kinematics, dynamics, solvers (tree-search, optimization, etc), and environment descriptions. All these tools are designed for both fast prototyping and deployment thanks to its c++ implementation and Python bindings. The DWL toolbox can be used in various software frameworks such as ROS and LCM, and for real-time control and planning.
  
  
  DWL was developed by Carlos Mastalli at [Dynamic Legged Systems lab (DLS)](http://www.iit.it/en/advr-labs/dynamic-legged-systems.html), Istituto Italiano di Tecnologia, Italy. The DWL is core toolbox used along of various software of the DLS lab at IIT.
