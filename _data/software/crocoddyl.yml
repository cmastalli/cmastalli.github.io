  *Crocoddyl* is an optimal control library for robot control under contact sequence. Its solver is based on an efficient Differential Dynamic Programming (DDP) algorithm. Crocoddyl computes optimal trajectories along to optimal feedback gains. It uses Pinocchio for fast computation of robot dynamics and its analytical derivatives. Crocoddyl employs differential geometry to properly describe the state of any geometrical system, e.g. floating-base systems. We have unified dynamics, costs, and constraints into a single concept — action — for greater efficiency and easy prototyping.
 
  Crocoddyl was developed by Carlos Mastalli within the EU MEMMO project. Crocoddyl is main toolbox used by various partners in the MEMMO consorsium.
