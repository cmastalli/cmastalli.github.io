title: "Review: Coursera Machine Learning"
---

I've recently completed Andrew Ng's Machine Learning course on Coursera and I am blown away at how clearly he explains and breaks down machine learning concepts and algorithms.  I appreciate the level of detail Andrew goes into each of his videos and how he explains the concepts as well as the math behind each algorithm.  

Here are the topics that were covered in the course:
- Supervised Learning
  - Linear regression
  - Logistic regression
  - Neural Networks
  - Support vector machines
- Unsupervised Learning
  - K-means
  - Principal Component Analysis
  - Anomaly Detection
- Recommender Systems
- Large Scale Machine Learning
- Advice on building a machine learning system

Along the way, Andrew also discussed various tips that can improve your algorithm and also common mistakes that people make when building machine learning systems.  

I really appreciate the work put into developing this course and I am glad I decided to take it. I would highly recommend anyone interested in machine learning to definitely take this course as it provides a solid introduction to various machine learning topics and sets a good foundation for jumping into more advanced courses.
