## New Year, New.....Site
I'm currently in the process of updating the look of my site. I'm working on creating a clean page for projects with sections for different topics/technologies and also nice way of displaying my blog posts.  I eventually want to add tags to my projects and posts and include a way of viewing all of those tags, but that will come later.  I'm still trying to relearn my way around HTML, CSS, and Jekyll.  

The following are features I want to include for my site:
- Project Page
	- List of all projects
	- Different sections for different technologies used/different topics
- Blog Page
	- Nice way of displaying blog posts. (What's nice?)
- Tags
	- List of all the tags for posts and projects
	- Click on any tag to jump to all the posts/projects with that tag

Hopefully I can finish all of this before the end of the week.

## Future Plans
I hope to use this site not only for my portfolio, but also to document and record my progress on different projects/online courses.  I hope to post a blog post at least every couple of days.

That's all for now!
